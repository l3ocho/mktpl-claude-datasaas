   - Long parameter lists (>3 params)
   - Duplicate code
   - Feature envy
   - Data clumps

2. **Assess Structure**
   - Single responsibility adherence
   - Coupling between modules
   - Cohesion within modules
   - Abstraction levels

3. **Recommend Refactorings**

   - Consider dependencies and side effects
   - Prioritize by impact and risk
   - Provide step-by-step approach
