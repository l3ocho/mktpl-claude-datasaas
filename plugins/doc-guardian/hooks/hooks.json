Do NOT read files or perform deep analysis - just note potential drift based on file name/path\n3. If potential drift: output a single line like '[doc-guardian] Note: {filename} changed - may affect {doc}. Run /doc-sync to verify.'\n4. If no obvious drift: say nothing\n\nIMPORTANT: This is notification-only. Do NOT read documentation files, do NOT make changes, do NOT use any tools. Just a quick mental check based on the file path."
