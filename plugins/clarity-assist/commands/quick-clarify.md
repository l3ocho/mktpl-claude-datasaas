## Purpose

Single-pass clarification for requests that are mostly clear but need minor disambiguation.

## When to Use

- Request is fairly clear, just one or two ambiguities
- User is in a hurry
- Follow-up to an already-clarified request
- Simple feature additions or bug fixes

## Skills to Load

- `skills/nd-accommodations.md` - ND-friendly question patterns
- `skills/clarification-techniques.md` - Echo and micro-summary techniques
- `skills/escalation-patterns.md` - When to escalate to full /clarify

## Workflow

1. **Echo Understanding** - Restate in a single sentence
2. **Quick Disambiguation** - Ask ONE multiple-choice question if needed
3. **Proceed or Confirm** - Start work or offer micro-summary

## Output Format

No formal specification document needed. Proceed after brief confirmation, documenting assumptions inline with the work.

## Escalation

If complexity emerges, offer to switch to full `/clarify`:

```
"This is more involved than it first appeared. Want me to switch
to a more thorough clarification process?"
```
